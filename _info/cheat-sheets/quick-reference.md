## The Dice

Roll **Trait Die + Wild Die (d6)** and take the higher result
- Compare to Target Number (usually 4)
- Roll the die type for your skill/attribute (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12)
- **Aces!** If you roll the max on any die, roll it again and add

### Common Target Numbers

| TN | Difficulty |
|----|------------|
| 4  | Standard task |
| 6  | Challenging task |
| 8  | Hard task |
| 10 | Very hard task |

## Four Actions

1. **Standard Actions** – Attack, use a skill, activate a power
2. **Move** – Pace in inches (usually 6" on foot)
3. **Free Actions** – Drop item, speak, etc.
4. **Multi-Action** – Take multiple actions at -2 each (max 3)

## Making Tests

- **Success:** Roll 4+ on your Trait die or Wild Die
- **Raise:** Every 4 points over the TN is a raise (4 = success, 8 = 1 raise, 12 = 2 raises)
- **Snake Eyes:** Roll 1 on both Trait die and Wild Die = critical failure

## Combat Basics

### Initiative
- Draw a card each round (Jokers act whenever they want with +2 to all rolls)
- When a Joker is dealt, **all players gain 1 Benny** (GM gains 1 per Wild Card)
- Act in order from highest to lowest (Ace high, Joker wild)

### Attack Roll
- **Fighting** (melee) or **Shooting** (ranged) vs. Target's **Parry** or **Range penalty**
- Success = hit, inflict weapon damage
- Each Raise = +1d6 damage

### Damage
- Roll weapon damage die (e.g., Str+d6 for melee, 2d8 for rifle)
- Compare to target's **Toughness**
- Success = **Shaken**, Raise = **Wound** (and Shaken)
- Wild Cards can take 3 Wounds before Incapacitation
- If the target is already Shaken and takes another Shaken result from damage, they take a Wound instead

*SWADE p. 94*

### Shaken
- Can't take actions except recover (Spirit roll)
- Can only take **free actions** (including movement)
- **Spirit roll** at start of turn: success removes Shaken and you may act

*SWADE p. 94*

## Bennies

**Bennies** are your fate points—spend them wisely!

- Start each session with 3 bennies
- **Reroll:** Spend 1 benny to reroll any Trait test
- **Soak:** Spend 1 benny after taking damage to make a Vigor roll and possibly avoid a Wound
- **Recover:** Spend 1 benny to automatically recover from Shaken

*Bennies: SWADE p. 89*
*Soak: SWADE p. 96*

## Wounds & Healing

- **Wounds:** Wild Cards can take 3 Wounds, each gives -1 to all Trait rolls
- **Incapacitated:** After 3 Wounds, roll on Injury Table
- **Natural Healing:** Vigor roll every 5 days; success heals 1 Wound
- **Medical Care:** Healing roll within the **Golden Hour**; success removes 1 Wound, raise removes 2
