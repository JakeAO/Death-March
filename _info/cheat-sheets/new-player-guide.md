Welcome to Death March! This is a survival-focused campaign using the Savage Worlds system. Here's what you need to know to get started.

## What is Savage Worlds?

Savage Worlds is a **fast, furious, and fun** tabletop RPG system. It's designed for:
- Quick character creation
- Fast-paced combat
- Dramatic action and tough choices
- Pulp adventure with deadly stakes

Key features:
- Roll dice vs. target numbers (usually 4)
- Exploding dice (roll max = roll again and add!)

## Death March Campaign

### The Setting
- **Zombie Apocalypse:** The dead walk, society collapsed
- **Road Trip:** You're in a convoy heading west to Rockies Haven
- **Survival Focus:** Food, water, fuel, and shelter matter
- **High Stakes:** Death is real, resources are scarce, choices have consequences

### The Tone
- **Gritty and Grounded:** This isn't superheroes—you're ordinary people in desperate times
- **Hope vs. Horror:** There's hope for Rockies Haven, but the journey is brutal
- **Group Survival:** You succeed or fail together as a convoy
- **Tough Decisions:** Sometimes there are no good choices

## Creating Your Character

### Choose Your Concept
Think about who you were before the apocalypse and who you've become:
- **Former profession:** Mechanic, soldier, teacher, EMT, construction worker?
- **Survival role:** Medic, driver, scavenger, protector, mechanic?
- **Personality:** Optimistic leader, cynical survivor, protective parent, haunted veteran?

### Pick Your Skills
Focus on skills that help the group survive:

**Combat Skills** (everyone needs at least one):
- **Fighting:** Melee combat (knives, axes, bats)
- **Shooting:** Guns (pistols, rifles, shotguns)

**Survival Skills** (critical for the journey):
- **Survival:** Tracking, foraging, navigation
- **Notice:** Spot threats, find supplies
- **Repair:** Fix vehicles and equipment
- **Healing:** Medical treatment

**Social Skills** (help with encounters):
- **Persuasion:** Negotiate and convince
- **Intimidation:** Threaten and scare
- **Common Knowledge:** Know useful facts

**Specialty Skills** (useful in specific situations):
- **Driving:** Operate vehicles (important!)
- **Athletics:** Physical actions
- **Stealth:** Sneak and hide

### Choose Your Edges
Edges are special abilities. Good starter edges:
- **Brawny:** +1 Toughness, carry more
- **Quick:** Redraw initiative cards of 5 or less
- **Steady Hands:** Ignore unstable platform penalty
- **Scavenger:** Better at finding supplies
- **Combat Edges:** Various combat bonuses

### Don't Dump Stats
You need decent:
- **Vigor:** For Toughness and resisting Fatigue
- **Smarts:** For Notice and problem-solving
- **Spirit:** For Recovering from Shaken

## Playing the Game

### In Combat
1. **Use Cover:** -4 to be hit is huge!
2. **Aim:** +2 to Shooting (if you don't move)
3. **Spend Bennies:** Reroll bad attacks, Soak damage
4. **Work Together:** Flanking, suppression, support actions
5. **Retreat:** Fighting is dangerous—know when to run

### Between Combats
1. **Scavenge:** Look for food, water, fuel, ammo
2. **Maintain Gear:** Keep vehicles and equipment working
3. **Rest:** Heal Wounds, recover Fatigue
4. **Plan:** Discuss routes, resources, and priorities
5. **Roleplay:** Build relationships with other survivors

### Spending Bennies
You start each session with 3 Bennies. Use them for:

**Priority 1: Staying Alive**
- Soak damage when you take Wounds
- Recover from Shaken in combat

**Priority 2: Critical Success**
- Reroll important skill checks
- Reroll missed attacks in key moments

**Don't Hoard:** Bennies don't carry over between sessions—use them!

## Survival Tips

### Resource Management
- **Food and Water:** Track carefully, scavenge regularly
- **Fuel:** Plan travel, don't waste gas
- **Ammo:** Melee weapons don't run out
- **Medical Supplies:** Treat Wounds quickly to avoid infection

### Combat is Dangerous
- **Avoid When Possible:** Fighting = risk of death
- **Use Stealth:** Sneak past zombies when you can
- **Save Ammo:** Gunfire attracts more zombies
- **Protect the Convoy:** Losing vehicles = losing supplies

### Group Dynamics
- **Communicate:** Share info, discuss plans
- **Specialize:** Each player should have unique skills
- **Share Resources:** The group's survival > individual hoarding
- **Make Tough Calls:** Sometimes you can't save everyone

## Common Situations

### Encountering Zombies
- **Small Group (1-5):** Fight or avoid
- **Medium Group (6-15):** Use tactics, focus fire
- **Horde (16+):** RUN. Use vehicles if possible.

### Meeting Survivors
- **Be Cautious:** Desperate people do desperate things
- **Negotiate:** Trade, don't fight if you can avoid it
- **Assess Threat:** Not everyone is friendly
- **Build Alliances:** More survivors = better chances

### Vehicle Breakdown
- **Immediate:** Defend while someone makes Repair rolls
- **Parts Needed:** Might need to scavenge nearby
- **Time Matters:** Don't get stuck after dark

### Running Low on Supplies
- **Scavenge:** Search buildings, vehicles, stores
- **Ration:** Reduce consumption, stretch resources
- **Hard Choices:** Who gets food/water when there isn't enough?

## Key Rules to Remember

1. **TN is usually 4:** You need to roll 4+ to succeed
2. **Raises at 4+:** Every 4 points over TN is a raise (4=success, 8=1 raise, 12=2 raises)
3. **Aces (Exploding Dice):** Max roll = roll again and add!
4. **Wild Die:** Roll your skill die + d6, take higher
5. **Bennies:** Spend them to reroll, Soak, or recover from Shaken
6. **Shaken:** Can only attempt to recover (Spirit roll)
7. **Wounds:** Wild Cards can take 3 before Incapacitation
8. **Multi-Action:** -2 to all actions (max 3 actions)
