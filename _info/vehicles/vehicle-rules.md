# Vehicle Rules

In Death March, vehicles are your lifeline. They carry your supplies, protect you from the dead, and get you closer to safety. But fuel is scarce, roads are dangerous, and one breakdown could be fatal.

## Vehicle Basics

### Key Stats
- **Acceleration/Top Speed:** How fast it can go
- **Toughness:** How much damage it can take before being disabled
- **Crew:** Driver + passengers
- **Mods:** Armor plating, reinforced bumpers, weapon mounts, etc.

### Common Vehicles

| Vehicle | Toughness | Crew | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------|-------|
| Motorcycle | 8 | 1-2 | Fast, maneuverable, vulnerable |
| Car (sedan) | 10 | 1+4 | Standard vehicle |
| SUV/Truck | 12 | 1+5 | More space, tougher |
| Van | 14 | 1+8 | Cargo space, slow |
| Semi-Truck | 16(4) | 1+1 | Heavy armor, slow, huge capacity |

*(Number in parentheses is armor bonus)*

## Operating Vehicles

### Normal Driving
- **No roll needed** for routine travel on clear roads
- **Driving roll** required for:
  - Bad terrain (mud, snow, debris)
  - Dangerous conditions (night, fog, storm)
  - Avoiding obstacles at speed
  - Evasive maneuvers

### Driving Tests
- **Standard TN:** 4 for most maneuvers
- **Failure:** Vehicle goes out of control (see below)
- **Raise:** Extra maneuverability or speed

## Chase Scenes

When speed matters and danger is close.

### Chase Rounds
Each round represents about 30 seconds of chase action.

### Chase Procedure
1. **Action Cards:** Deal initiative cards
2. **Movement:** Each vehicle moves based on its speed
3. **Actions:** Driver makes Driving rolls for maneuvers; passengers can shoot, etc.
4. **Resolution:** Chase ends when someone crashes, escapes, or is caught

### Chase Modifiers

| Condition | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| Bad terrain | -2 |
| Night/fog | -2 |
| Debris/obstacles | -1 to -4 |
| High speed | -2 |
| Passenger actions | -2 (Multi-Action) |

## Vehicular Combat

### Ramming
- **Driver rolls Driving vs. target's Parry or Driving**
- **Success:** Roll vehicle damage (usually 2d6 or 3d6)
- **Target takes damage** minus vehicle Toughness
- **Attacker takes half damage** (to vehicle)

### Shooting from Vehicles
- **Unstable Platform:** -2 to Shooting rolls
- **Called Shots at vehicle:** -2 (or -4 for tires/driver)
- **Damage to vehicle:** Compare to vehicle Toughness

### Vehicle Damage
- **Wound equivalent:** Vehicles don't take Wounds but get "disabled" results
- **Major damage:** Reduces vehicle performance (speed, handling)
- **Critical hit:** Vehicle might catch fire, lose control, or be destroyed

## Out of Control

When a vehicle goes out of control:
1. **Driver rolls Driving at -2**
2. **Success:** Regain control
3. **Failure:** Vehicle spins, crashes, or goes off road
4. **Snake Eyes:** Serious crash (roll on Crash Table)

### Crash Damage
Occupants take damage based on speed and impact:
- **Low speed (under 30 mph):** 2d6 damage
- **Medium speed (30-60 mph):** 3d6 damage
- **High speed (60+ mph):** 4d6 or more damage

Seatbelts reduce damage by 2 (if worn).

## Fuel & Maintenance

### Fuel Consumption
Track fuel abstractly or in detail:
- **Abstract:** Vehicles need refueling every few days of travel
- **Detailed:** Track gallons per mile (varies by vehicle)

### Finding Fuel
- **Scavenging gas stations:** Notice or Survival roll
- **Siphoning vehicles:** Repair roll
- **Average find:** 5-10 gallons per successful scavenge

### Vehicle Repair
Vehicles need maintenance:
- **Minor issues:** Repair roll (takes 1 hour)
- **Major damage:** Repair roll at -2 (takes 4+ hours, needs parts)
- **Critical damage:** Might need multiple rolls and rare parts

### Breaking Down
Without maintenance, vehicles degrade:
- **Every week of hard use:** Repair roll to avoid breakdown
- **Failure:** Vehicle needs repairs or stops working

## Modifications

Survivors can modify vehicles:

| Mod | Effect | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Armor plating | +2 to +4 Toughness | Reduces speed |
| Ram bars | +1d6 ram damage | Protects front |
| Weapon mount | Fixed weapon | Driver or passenger operates |
| Fuel tanks | +50% fuel capacity | Takes cargo space |
| Reinforced tires | Harder to disable | +2 vs. tire damage |
| Storage racks | +25% cargo | External (vulnerable) |

Each mod requires Repair rolls and scavenged materials.

## Convoy Travel

### Group Movement
- **Convoy speed:** Slowest vehicle sets pace
- **Staggered formation:** Reduces risk of mass ambush
- **Lead vehicle:** Scouts ahead, spots threats

### Convoy Challenges
- **Fuel:** Different vehicles have different consumption
- **Breakdowns:** One vehicle breaks down, whole convoy stops
- **Defense:** Easier to defend a group, harder to hide

## Zombie Encounters

### Hitting Zombies
- **At speed:** Automatically run down zombies in path
- **Damage to vehicle:** Minimal (1-2 zombies = no damage)
- **Horde (10+):** Vehicle must make Driving roll or slow/stop

### Zombies Attacking Vehicles
- **Grabbing:** Zombies can grab onto moving vehicles (Driving roll to shake them off)
- **Surrounded:** If stopped, zombies can eventually break windows/doors
- **Time matters:** Don't stop in a horde!

**Remember:** Your vehicle is your lifeline. Protect it, maintain it, and never run out of gas in zombie territory.
