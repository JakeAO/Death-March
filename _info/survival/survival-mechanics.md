# Survival Mechanics

In Death March, staying alive isn't just about fighting zombies. Hunger, thirst, exposure, and exhaustion are just as deadly.

## The Survival Checklist

Every day, survivors need:
- **Food:** 1 meal per day (minimum)
- **Water:** 2 quarts per day (1 gallon in hot weather)
- **Rest:** 6-8 hours of sleep
- **Shelter:** Protection from weather extremes

## Fatigue Levels

Characters can take **Fatigue levels** from various sources. Each level gives **-1 penalty** to all Trait rolls and Pace.

| Fatigue Level | Effect |
|---------------|--------|
| 0 | Normal |
| 1 | -1 to all rolls, -1 Pace |
| 2 | -2 to all rolls, -2 Pace |
| 3+ | Incapacitated |

### Recovering Fatigue
- **Rest:** 1 hour of rest removes 1 level of Fatigue from exhaustion
- **Food/Water:** Addressing the need removes 1 level (for that specific cause)
- **Good night's sleep:** Removes all Fatigue (if needs are met)

## Hunger

### Going Without Food
- **1 day:** No effect (most people can skip a meal)
- **2 days:** No effect with successful Vigor roll, otherwise 1 Fatigue
- **3+ days:** Vigor roll at -1 per day past second day; failure = 1 Fatigue
- **Cumulative:** Each failed roll adds another Fatigue level

### Finding Food
- **Scavenging:** Survival or Notice roll to find food in abandoned areas
- **Hunting/Fishing:** Survival roll (takes several hours)
- **Foraging:** Survival roll to find edible plants (unreliable in winter)

## Thirst

Dehydration is more dangerous than hunger.

### Going Without Water
- **1 day:** Vigor roll at -2; failure = 1 Fatigue
- **Each additional day:** Vigor roll at cumulative -2; failure = additional Fatigue
- **3+ days without water:** You're likely dying

### Finding Water
- **Scavenging:** Notice or Survival roll
- **Natural sources:** Requires Survival roll to find safe water
- **Purification:** Healing or Survival roll to purify questionable water

## Exposure

Extreme weather without proper shelter causes Fatigue.

### Cold Weather
- **Every 4 hours exposed:** Vigor roll; failure = 1 Fatigue
- **Modifiers:** -2 in freezing temps, -4 in extreme cold, +2 if wearing winter gear
- **Shelter:** Proper shelter negates exposure

### Hot Weather
- **Every 4 hours in extreme heat:** Vigor roll; failure = 1 Fatigue
- **Modifiers:** -2 if no shade/water, +2 if resting in shade
- **Requires extra water:** Double water consumption in heat

## Exhaustion

Pushing beyond normal limits causes exhaustion.

### Forced March
- **Normal travel:** 8 hours per day at Pace
- **Extended travel:** For each 4 hours beyond 8, Vigor roll; failure = 1 Fatigue
- **Running/Combat:** After extended chase or prolonged combat, Vigor roll; failure = 1 Fatigue

## Sleep Deprivation

Lack of sleep accumulates over time.

### Going Without Sleep
- **24 hours awake:** Vigor roll; failure = 1 Fatigue
- **Each additional 12 hours:** Another Vigor roll at cumulative -2; failure = 1 Fatigue
- **Cannot stay awake:** After 3 Fatigue from exhaustion, character falls asleep

## Disease & Infection

In the apocalypse, simple infections can kill.

### Untreated Wounds
- **Open wounds after 24 hours:** Vigor roll; failure = Fatigue and infection
- **Infection:** -2 penalty to Vigor for natural healing until treated
- **Treatment:** Healing roll to clean and dress wounds

### Disease Exposure
- **Contaminated food/water:** Vigor roll; failure = disease (Fatigue + possible Wounds)
- **Dead bodies:** Extended exposure requires Vigor roll to avoid sickness

## Survival Gear

Key equipment for staying alive:

| Item | Benefit |
|------|---------|
| Water purification tablets | +2 to purify water |
| Cold weather gear | +2 vs. cold exposure |
| First aid kit | +1 to Healing rolls |
| Sleeping bag | Protection from cold at night |
| Rations (MRE) | 1 day of food |
| Water container | Store 1 gallon water |

## GM Tips

- Track resources (food, water, ammo) as group resources
- Make Fatigue meaningful but not overwhelming
- Allow creative solutions (hunting, trading, scavenging)
- Weather and environment should be ongoing threats
- Use Survival checks to create tension during travel

**Remember:** The apocalypse is about survival. Every decision matters.
