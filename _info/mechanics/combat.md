## Combat Overview

Combat in Savage Worlds is fast and deadly. Every round represents about 6 seconds of action.

## Initiative (Action Cards)

At the start of each round:
1. **Deal Cards:** Each player and GM draws one card per PC/group of enemies
2. **Jokers:** Jokers are wild—act whenever you want and get +2 to all Trait and damage rolls this round!
3. **Act in Order:** From highest card to lowest (Ace high, then King, Queen, etc.)

## Attack Rolls

### Melee Combat
- **Roll:** Fighting skill vs. target's **Parry** (usually 2 + half Fighting die)
- **Success:** Hit and roll damage
- **Raise:** Hit and add +1d6 to damage roll

### Ranged Combat
- **Roll:** Shooting skill vs. TN of 4, modified by **Range** and **Cover**
- **Success:** Hit and roll damage
- **Raise:** Hit and add +1d6 to damage roll

### Range Modifiers
- **Short range:** No penalty
- **Medium range:** -2
- **Long range:** -4
- **Extreme range:** -8

## Damage

When you hit:
1. **Roll Damage:** Roll the weapon's damage die (e.g., Str+d6 for knife, 2d6 for pistol)
2. **Add Raises:** +1d6 per raise on the attack roll
3. **Compare to Toughness:** Target's Toughness is usually 2 + half Vigor die + Armor

### Damage Results
- **Failure:** No effect
- **Success:** Target is **Shaken**
- **Raise:** Target takes a **Wound** (and is Shaken)
- **Multiple Raises:** Each raise beyond the first = additional Wound

## Shaken

When Shaken, a character:
- Cannot take actions except attempt to recover
- **Recover:** Roll Spirit at start of turn
  - **Success:** Recover and act normally
  - **Failure:** Remain Shaken
  - **1 on Spirit die and Wild Die:** Take a Wound!

**Spending a Benny:** Automatically recover from Shaken

## Wounds

**Extras** (minor NPCs) are Incapacitated after one Wound.

**Wild Cards** (PCs and major NPCs) can take 3 Wounds:
- Each Wound gives **-1 penalty** to Pace and all Trait rolls (cumulative)
- After 3 Wounds, character is **Incapacitated**

### Incapacitation
Roll on the **Injury Table** (d100) to determine fate:
- Could be knocked out, bleeding out, injured, maimed, or killed

## Soaking Damage

Immediately after taking damage, spend a **Benny** to make a **Vigor roll**:
- **Success:** Reduce damage by 1 Wound
- **Raise:** Reduce damage by 2 Wounds
- You can Soak multiple times for multiple Wounds

## Called Shots

Target a specific location for special effects:
- **Penalty:** -2 to attack (or -4 for head)
- **Limb:** No extra damage, but may disarm or slow target
- **Head:** +4 to damage if successful

## Two Weapons

Fighting with two weapons:
- Make one attack roll at no penalty
- If you hit, add +1 to damage
- If using different weapons, use the lower damage die

**Remember:** Combat is dangerous. Use cover, tactics, and spend Bennies to survive!
