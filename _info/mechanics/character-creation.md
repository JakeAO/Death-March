This guide covers the core, non-magical character creation rules used in Death March.

## Step 1: Concept
Decide who you are, what you did before the fall, and what role you fill in the convoy.

*SWADE p. 9*

## Step 2: Ancestry/Race
All Death March characters are human. Being so means they have the Adaptable trait, which allows them to take any Novice Edge for free at character creation (as long as they meet its Requirements).

*SWADE p. 12-17*

## Step 3: Hindrances (Max 4 Points)
Hindrances define flaws and grant points to improve your character.

- **Major** = 2 points
- **Minor** = 1 point
- Max benefit is **4 points** total

You can spend Hindrance points on:
- **2 points**: Raise an attribute one die type, or take an Edge
- **1 point**: Gain one skill point, or gain extra starting funds (double starting amount)

*SWADE p. 22*

## Step 4: Attributes (5 Points)
All attributes start at **d4**. You have **5 points** to raise them.

Attributes: Agility, Smarts, Spirit, Strength, Vigor.

*SWADE p. 10, 29*

## Step 5: Core Skills (5 at d4) + Skill Points (12)
All characters start with **d4** in the five core skills:
- Athletics, Common Knowledge, Notice, Persuasion, Stealth

You then have **12 points** to buy or raise skills.
- If a skill is **at or below** its linked attribute, it costs **1 point** per die type.
- If a skill is **above** its linked attribute, it costs **2 points** per die type.

*SWADE p. 10, 55*

## Step 6: Derived Stats
Fill in these values:
- **Pace**: 6 by default (movement in combat)
- **Parry**: 2 + half your Fighting die type
- **Toughness**: 2 + half your Vigor die type + Armor
- **Size**: 0 for humans

*SWADE p. 10*

## Step 7: Edges
Edges are special advantages that differentiate characters.

*SWADE p. 37*

## Step 8: Starting Gear and Funds
Start with **$500** of gear and equipment appropriate to your character's background.

*SWADE p. 10, 65*

## Step 9: Background Details
Add personality, goals, and connections to the world.
