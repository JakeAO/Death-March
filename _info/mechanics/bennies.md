## What Are Bennies?

**Bennies** (short for "benefits") are tokens that represent luck, fate, and heroic determination. They're your get-out-of-jail-free cards—use them to survive, succeed, and save the day.

## Starting Bennies

- **Players start each session with 3 Bennies**
- GM may award extra Bennies for great roleplaying, clever ideas, or heroic actions
- Unused Bennies do NOT carry over between sessions

*SWADE p. 89*

## Using Bennies

You can spend a Benny to:

### 1. Reroll a Trait Test
- After you roll, spend 1 Benny to reroll any Trait test
- Keep the **highest** total of your rolls
- You can keep spending Bennies to reroll the same test
- **Critical Failures stand** and cannot be rerolled

### 2. Recover from Shaken
- Spend 1 Benny to **automatically** recover from being Shaken
- This is instant and can be done at any time

### 3. Soak Damage
- Immediately after taking damage, spend 1 Benny to make a **Vigor roll**
- **Success:** Reduce damage by 1 Wound
- **Raise:** Reduce damage by 2 Wounds
- If you Soak all Wounds from the attack, you also remove **Shaken**
- You can’t Soak more than once per attack, but you may spend Bennies to **reroll** the Soak roll

### 4. Draw a New Action Card
- When initiative is in rounds, spend 1 Benny to draw a new Action Card after cards are dealt

### 5. Influence the Story
- Spend 1 Benny to add a reasonable story detail or useful item (GM approval)

## Earning Bennies

The GM may award Bennies during play for:
- **Great roleplaying** that enhances the story
- **Clever tactics** or creative problem-solving
- **Heroic actions** that fit your character
- **Making everyone laugh** or enhancing the session

## Wild Cards vs. Extras

### Wild Cards
- **Player Characters** are always Wild Cards
- **Important NPCs** (main villains, key allies) are Wild Cards
- Roll **both Trait die and Wild Die (d6)** and take the higher result
- Can take **3 Wounds** before Incapacitation
- Can spend **Bennies**
- Tougher, more resilient, heroic

### Extras
- **Minor NPCs** (mooks, random enemies, bystanders)
- Roll **only their Trait die** (no Wild Die)
- **One Wound** and they're out (Incapacitated)
- **No Bennies**
- Easier to defeat

## Strategy Tips

### When to Spend Bennies
- **Life or death situations:** Always Soak if you're about to die
- **Critical rolls:** Reroll important skill tests that you failed
- **Getting Shaken in combat:** Usually better to Soak damage before you're Shaken
- **Save 1-2 for emergencies:** Don't blow all your Bennies early

### When NOT to Spend Bennies
- **Minor failures:** Save them for critical moments
- **When you have backup:** Let allies help instead
- **When success doesn't matter:** Don't waste them on trivial rolls

## Jokers Give Bennies

When you draw a **Joker** for initiative:
- You act whenever you want this round
- You get **+2 to all Trait and damage rolls** this round
- **All players gain 1 Benny**
- The GM gains **1 Benny per Wild Card** in the encounter

**Remember:** Bennies make you heroic. Don't hoard them—use them to survive and succeed!
