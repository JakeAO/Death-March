## Making a Skill Test

To attempt an action:
1. **Choose appropriate skill** (or attribute if untrained)
2. **Roll Trait die + Wild Die (d6)** and take the higher result
3. **Add modifiers** (situational bonuses/penalties)
4. **Compare to Target Number** (usually 4)

### Results
- **Failure (under TN):** Action fails
- **Success (4+):** Action succeeds
- **Raise (4+ over TN):** Extra success! (Each full 4 points is a raise)

## Aces (Exploding Dice)

When any die shows its maximum value:
1. Roll it again and **add** the result
2. Keep rolling and adding if you keep rolling max
3. Example: Roll d6, get 6 → roll again, get 4 = total 10!

## Opposed Rolls

When two characters compete:
- Both roll their appropriate skill
- Highest total wins
- Ties generally mean **no effect** (in Tests, ties favor the defender)

## Support Rolls

Allies can help with a task using Support:
- Each helper makes a related skill roll
- **Success:** +1 to the leader’s roll
- **Raise:** +2 to the leader’s roll
- Total Support bonus is capped at **+4**

## Unskilled Attempts

If you don't have the skill:
- Roll a **d4** for the skill die and subtract **-2** from the total
- The GM may rule some tasks can’t be attempted unskilled

## Common Modifiers

| Situation | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| Easy task | +2 |
| Hard task | -2 |
| Very difficult | -4 |
| Nearly impossible | -6 |
| Favorable conditions | +1 to +2 |
| Poor conditions | -1 to -2 |
| Distracted | -2 |
| Rushed | -2 |
| Prepared/planned | +1 to +2 |

## Multi-Actions

Take multiple actions in one turn:
- Declare all actions before rolling
- Each action suffers **-2 penalty** (including first)
- Maximum 3 actions per turn
- Example: Shoot twice = -2 to both shots

## Retries

If you fail a task:
- You generally cannot retry the same approach
- Try a different skill or method
- Or wait for circumstances to change

## Tests and Defend (Quick)
