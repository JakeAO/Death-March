# Skills & Tests

## Making a Skill Test

To attempt an action:
1. **Choose appropriate skill** (or attribute if untrained)
2. **Roll Trait die + Wild Die (d6)** and take the higher result
3. **Add modifiers** (situational bonuses/penalties)
4. **Compare to Target Number** (usually 4)

### Results
- **Failure (under TN):** Action fails
- **Success (4+):** Action succeeds
- **Raise (4+ over TN):** Extra success! (Each full 4 points is a raise)

## Aces (Exploding Dice)

When any die shows its maximum value:
1. Roll it again and **add** the result
2. Keep rolling and adding if you keep rolling max
3. Example: Roll d6, get 6 → roll again, get 4 = total 10!

## Opposed Rolls

When two characters compete:
- Both roll their appropriate skill
- Highest result wins
- Ties: Highest die type wins; if still tied, re-roll

## Cooperative Rolls

Allies can help with a task:
- Each helper makes the same skill roll at -2
- Each success gives the leader +1 to their roll
- Leader makes their roll with bonuses

## Unskilled Attempts

If you don't have the skill:
- Roll the linked attribute at **-2** (e.g., Smarts-2 for untrained Repair)
- Some skills can't be attempted untrained (marked with * in rules)

## Common Modifiers

| Situation | Modifier |
|-----------|----------|
| Easy task | +2 |
| Hard task | -2 |
| Very difficult | -4 |
| Nearly impossible | -6 |
| Favorable conditions | +1 to +2 |
| Poor conditions | -1 to -2 |
| Distracted | -2 |
| Rushed | -2 |
| Prepared/planned | +1 to +2 |

## Multi-Actions

Take multiple actions in one turn:
- Declare all actions before rolling
- Each action suffers **-2 penalty** (including first)
- Maximum 3 actions per turn
- Example: Shoot twice = -2 to both shots

## Retries

If you fail a task:
- You generally cannot retry the same approach
- Try a different skill or method
- Or wait for circumstances to change

## Common Skills

### Combat
- **Fighting:** Hand-to-hand combat
- **Shooting:** Ranged attacks
- **Athletics:** Physical actions, throwing

### Social
- **Intimidation:** Frighten or threaten
- **Persuasion:** Convince or negotiate
- **Taunt:** Mock or anger someone

### Knowledge

## Support Actions

Instead of attacking, you can use skills to help allies:
- **Test:** Use Intimidation or Taunt to make enemy Distracted/Vulnerable (-2 to next roll)
- **Trick:** Use opposed skill to make target Distracted or Vulnerable
- **Defend:** Use full action to add +4 to Parry until next turn
