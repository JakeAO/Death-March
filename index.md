## The Premise

The dead walk. Civilization collapsed. The coasts burned, and the cities became graveyards. Now, winter is coming, and if you don't reach the Rockies before the snow falls, you won't reach them at all.

You're part of a desperate convoy heading west—survivors who've heard rumors of a place called **Rockies Haven**, somewhere in the mountains where people are rebuilding, where there's food, shelter, and safety. Maybe it's real. Maybe it's a lie someone told themselves to keep moving. But it's the only hope you've got.

The road is long. Gas is scarce. The dead are everywhere. And the living? They might be worse.

You've got vehicles, some supplies, a handful of weapons, and each other. That's it. Every mile is a gamble. Every stop could be your last. Every decision matters.

**This is a death march. Will you survive it?**

## Atmosphere

- **Survival Road Trip:** Oregon Trail meets The Walking Dead—resource management, tough choices, and brutal consequences
- **Desperate Journey:** Every mile west is earned through blood, sweat, and hard decisions
- **Hope and Horror:** Rockies Haven might save you all... if it exists, and if you can reach it
- **Zombie Apocalypse:** The dead are relentless, but starvation, exposure, and desperate people are just as deadly
- **Convoy Drama:** Personal conflicts, limited resources, and the question: who do you save when you can't save everyone?

## System

This campaign uses **Savage Worlds Adventure Edition**, a fast, furious, and fun RPG system designed for pulp action and dramatic scenarios. See the [Info section]({{ "/info/" | relative_url }}) for rules, survival mechanics, vehicle rules, and resources for new players.
